# Vently – Anonymous Mental Health Chat Scheduler
Role: Project Coordinator / Business Analyst (Personal roject)
Tools Used: Word, Figma , Miro

## Project Overview:
Conceptualized and developed as a personal project to demonstrate proficiency in core business analysis and coordination skills. Vently is a mental health support app idea that allows users to book private, anonymous chat sessions with trained listeners. The project was designed to simulate real-world BA/PM deliverables.

## Key Responsibilities:

Authored a complete Business Requirements Document (BRD) including problem statement, goals, scope, assumptions, and success metrics

Created structured User Stories and a User Story Map covering multiple roles (User, Listener, Admin)

Designed grayscale Wireframes for the booking flow, listener profile, and chat session screens

Applied MoSCoW method for feature prioritization and defined the MVP scope

Practiced Agile-style documentation and coordination techniques to mirror real-world project planning

## Outcome:
Strengthened practical experience in business analysis and digital project coordination by producing deliverables aligned with industry standards.


Vently connects individuals seeking a listening ear with trained listeners — anonymously. Users can schedule private chat sessions, share their feelings, and get the support they need without revealing their identity.

Through this project, I’ve not only built a user-centered solution, but also strengthened my skills in business analysis, problem solving, and digital product thinking.

I’m excited to keep building on this. Open to feedback, collaboration, or even mentorship to help shape it further!
